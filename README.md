- **Large PDF Processing**: Stable memory usage regardless of file size
- **Large Dataset Editing**: Memory independent of dataset size

### Processing Speed
- **Small PDFs (< 5MB)**: < 30 seconds
- **Medium PDFs (5-20MB)**: 1-2 minutes
- **Large PDFs (20-50MB)**: 2-5 minutes with progress tracking
- **Very Large PDFs (> 50MB)**: Chunked processing with time estimates

### Scalability
- **PDF Size**: Tested up to 200+ pages
- **Dataset Size**: Handle 10,000+ dialogues smoothly
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple PDFs simultaneously
- **Export Capacity**: Generate large training datasets efficiently

## üîß Configuration

### Detection Modes
- **Auto**: Combines regex patterns and semantic similarity
- **Regex Only**: Fast pattern-based detection
- **Semantic Only**: AI-powered similarity detection

### Scoring Criteria
- **Direct Pointing**: References to awareness, being, consciousness
- **Non-Dual Language**: "No seeker", "not two", "only consciousness"
- **Disidentification**: "Not the body", "not thoughts", "ego is illusion"
- **Presence**: "Right now", "this moment", "be still"
- **Avoid Seeking**: Penalties for practice-oriented language
- **Non-Conceptual**: Penalties for intellectual explanations

### Chunking Settings
- **Chunk Size**: 5-50 pages (default: 20)
- **Force Chunking**: Enable for testing on small files
- **Progress Display**: Real-time processing feedback

## üßò Consciousness Recognition Criteria

The system evaluates dialogues based on non-dual consciousness recognition principles:

### ‚úÖ **High-Quality Indicators**
- Direct pointing to awareness/consciousness
- Present-moment emphasis
- Disidentification from thoughts/body
- Non-dual language ("not two", "only consciousness")
- Immediate recognition over gradual development

### ‚ùå **Low-Quality Indicators**
- Practice-oriented seeking language
- Future-based attainment concepts
- Intellectual explanations without direct pointing
- Person-based identity reinforcement
- Complex philosophical concepts

### üéØ **Scoring Algorithm**
- **Direct Pointing** (25%): "You are awareness", "remain as you are"
- **Non-Dual** (20%): "No seeker", "only consciousness"
- **Disidentification** (20%): "Not the body", "not thoughts"
- **Presence** (15%): "Right now", "this moment"
- **Avoid Seeking** (10%): Penalty for practice language
- **Non-Conceptual** (10%): Penalty for intellectual explanations

- Use chunking with 10-20 pages per chunk
- Monitor memory usage during processing
- Consider splitting very large files
- Use progress tracking to monitor completion

### For Large Datasets (> 1000 dialogues)
- Use pagination in Viewer & Editor (50-100 items per page)
- Apply filters to reduce working set
- Use batch operations for efficiency
- Export in smaller batches if needed

### Memory Optimization
- Clear cache periodically during long sessions
- Use "Reset All" if experiencing performance issues
- Monitor memory usage in sidebar
- Close browser tab to fully reset if needed
